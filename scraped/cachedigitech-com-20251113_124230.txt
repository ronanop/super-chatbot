Founder & Chairperson, Cache Digitech Pvt. Ltd.

Founder, CIO Digital Foundation (CIDIF)
"When you lead with purpose, innovation finds its direction."
34+Years JourneyGlobalTechnology Partner"Rooted in values and driven by innovation where technology built on trust transforms lives with purpose and empathy."

The Beginning
When I began this journey more than three decades ago, I didn't have a large team or endless resources just a deep conviction to create something meaningful, built on values, hard work, and trust. That conviction gave birth to Cache Digitech Pvt. Ltd., which has today evolved into a trusted global technology partner empowering organizations across the world.

Vision & Purpose
At Cache, we continue to innovate across Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, and IT Infrastructure, helping businesses stay secure, agile, and future-ready. Yet, beyond technology, what defines us is our belief that innovation must serve people it must inspire, include, and uplift.
Through CIDIF (CIO Digital Foundation), I've extended that vision to empower young minds, bridging the gap between aspiration and opportunity, and preparing the next generation of digital leaders.
For me, technology is not just a business it's a responsibility. A responsibility to use knowledge, empathy, and creativity to make the world a more connected, secure, and compassionate place.
Every step we take at Cache reflects this purpose. And as we move forward, one thing will never change our promise to keep our customers first, always.

Founder's Message

Prarthana Gupta
Founder & Chairperson, Cache Digitech Pvt. Ltd.
Managing Director, Calipers Consulting Pvt. Ltd.
Founder, CIO Digital Foundation (CIDIF)
"When you lead with purpose, innovation finds its direction."
34+Years JourneyGlobalTechnology Partner"Rooted in values and driven by innovation where technology built on trust transforms lives with purpose and empathy."

The Beginning
When I began this journey more than three decades ago, I didn't have a large team or endless resources just a deep conviction to create something meaningful, built on values, hard work, and trust. That conviction gave birth to Cache Digitech Pvt. Ltd., which has today evolved into a trusted global technology partner empowering organizations across the world.
From day one, our attitude has been simple yet unwavering always put the customer first. Every milestone we've achieved is the result of relentless effort, sleepless nights, and a firm belief that trust must be earned, not claimed.
Today, as we see that trust growing with customers placing their confidence in us year after year it fills me with both pride and gratitude. It reaffirms that when you lead with honesty, consistency, and care, success becomes a shared journey.

Vision & Purpose
At Cache, we continue to innovate across Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, and IT Infrastructure, helping businesses stay secure, agile, and future-ready. Yet, beyond technology, what defines us is our belief that innovation must serve people it must inspire, include, and uplift.
Through CIDIF (CIO Digital Foundation), I've extended that vision to empower young minds, bridging the gap between aspiration and opportunity, and preparing the next generation of digital leaders.
For me, technology is not just a business it's a responsibility. A responsibility to use knowledge, empathy, and creativity to make the world a more connected, secure, and compassionate place.
Every step we take at Cache reflects this purpose. And as we move forward, one thing will never change our promise to keep our customers first, always.

Founder's Message

Prarthana Gupta
Founder & Chairperson, Cache Digitech Pvt. Ltd.
Managing Director, Calipers Consulting Pvt. Ltd.
Founder, CIO Digital Foundation (CIDIF)
"When you lead with purpose, innovation finds its direction."
34+Years JourneyGlobalTechnology Partner"Rooted in values and driven by innovation where technology built on trust transforms lives with purpose and empathy."

The Beginning
When I began this journey more than three decades ago, I didn't have a large team or endless resources just a deep conviction to create something meaningful, built on values, hard work, and trust. That conviction gave birth to Cache Digitech Pvt. Ltd., which has today evolved into a trusted global technology partner empowering organizations across the world.
From day one, our attitude has been simple yet unwavering always put the customer first. Every milestone we've achieved is the result of relentless effort, sleepless nights, and a firm belief that trust must be earned, not claimed.
Today, as we see that trust growing with customers placing their confidence in us year after year it fills me with both pride and gratitude. It reaffirms that when you lead with honesty, consistency, and care, success becomes a shared journey.

Vision & Purpose
At Cache, we continue to innovate across Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, and IT Infrastructure, helping businesses stay secure, agile, and future-ready. Yet, beyond technology, what defines us is our belief that innovation must serve people it must inspire, include, and uplift.
Through CIDIF (CIO Digital Foundation), I've extended that vision to empower young minds, bridging the gap between aspiration and opportunity, and preparing the next generation of digital leaders.
For me, technology is not just a business it's a responsibility. A responsibility to use knowledge, empathy, and creativity to make the world a more connected, secure, and compassionate place.
Every step we take at Cache reflects this purpose. And as we move forward, one thing will never change our promise to keep our customers first, always.
